          - now properly handle .pod files, and others where the package name
            does not directly correspond with the equivalent .pm, by testing
            by filename rather than package name
          - now correctly handling case where an indexed module has an undef
            version (always documented as considered acceptable)
          - also respect 'provides' metadata for the module's new version, if
            present and VERSION not set directly in the package

          - now properly injecting prereqs for things used by our tests that
            were not being picked up automatically
          - fix broken tests by more sensibly picking a module to simulate a
            release against

          - dev release with more detailed test description to see why many
            cpantesters machines are failing

0.005     2013-08-04 22:59:22 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - fix wrong-headed test that will *always* fail when testing this
            distribution after the PAUSE index has updated (double doh!)

0.004     2013-08-03 18:26:52 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - delay inserting the list of modules to check until after all
            plugins have had an opportunity to add files (found via RT#87562)

0.003     2013-08-03 12:46:25 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - now properly using Test::More and setting a plan (doh!)
          - properly handle files that are generated by other plugins, vs.
            existing statically on disk (RT#87562)

0.002     2013-07-17 11:40:24 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - fix pod munging
          - modules used by the test are injected as develop requires

0.001     2013-06-23 12:09:18 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
